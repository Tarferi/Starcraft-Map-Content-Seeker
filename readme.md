# Starcraft Map Content Seeker
This program was made by Tarferi for his friend SI.
\
Its primary function is to scan Starcraft map folders for contact info of friends long lost.
\
Initial regex is for emails. Scan for emails or any other contact info and find your friends again.
\
Get in touch.
\
Life is short.
